           <p>The site plan document describes the site name, site purpose, target audience,
             color scheme and application, typography and usually 
             contains wire-frame sketch of the different views. In this Website, I included the following 
             sections as pages:
           </p>
           <h3>Site Name</h3>
           <p>
            South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
           </p>
           
           <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
           <p>
            The site purpose represent the business interests by influencing policy and legislative development and 
            regulation. We engage government and legislatures or regulators in respect of certain of the regulations 
            or pieces of legislation that we think would not be conducive for our business members or the economy in 
            general or job creation. We are consulted in a lot of the policy that government looks at.

           </p>
          
   
           <h3>Target Audience</h3>
           <p>
